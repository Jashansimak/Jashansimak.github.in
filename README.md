 First day of training 

In first day of training, i learned about linux in detail and different types of companies. 
   
    Linux is the core of the operating system,            responsible for managing hardware resources and providing a platform for other software.
Linux is open source and much better than windows.Linux is known for its stability and security. 
To install Linux on laptops , there are some steps to followed: 
       
       Download Virtualbox 7.1.10
       Download Microsoft c++ visual studio 
       Download ubnut desktop 24.04.2 LTS 

The main difference between Linux and windows is  Linux is free and open source , windows are  not open source. 
Linux considered more secure due to its open-source nature, windows are less secure.
Linux is free of cost , windows are not free of cost.

Then, we discussed about different types of companies.
           
            product based companies 
            service based companies 
            startup companies

After that I learned about Booting and its types 
  
Booting - Booting is the process of starting or resetting a computer.
 It has two main types: 

   cold booting and warm booting. 

Cold booting is starting a computer from a completely powered-off state, while warm booting is restarting a computer that is already on.

      /boot:            Stores files needed for booting the system, including the kernel.
     
       /dev:            Contains device files that represent hardware devices.

       /lib:             Contains library files that are used by programs.

       /tmp:            Stores temporary files.
    
      /usr:            Contains user-related programs, libraries, and documentation.
    
      /var:           Stores variable data, such as log files, user tracking data, and caches.  

  commands
  
               Commands           Description                         Syntax
   
               ls               List the contents                     ls(options)

             date          Show the current date and time .           date

             whoami         Display the current username.              whomami    

             cd               change the directory .                  cd[directory]

             mkdir              To create new directory                mkdir directory_name

             cat                Create a list with contents            cat>filename

             touch               create file without content          touch filename

             cp                  copy the files                        cp[source]

             pwd                 print the current working directory       pwd

             whereis              show location of binary ,source         whereis[command]

Dual Booting 
Dual-booting refers to the process of installing and running two different operating systems on a single computer, allowing the user to choose which one to use when starting the machine.

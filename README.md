First day of training 

In first day of training, i learned about linux in detail and different types of companies. 
    Linux is the core of the operating system,          responsible for managing hardware resources and providing a platform for other software.
Linux is open source and much better than windows.Linux is known for its stability and security. 
To install Linux on laptops , there are some steps to followed: 
       
       Download Virtualbox 7.1.10
       Download Microsoft c++ visual studio 
       Download ubnut desktop 24.04.2 LTS 

The main difference between Linux and windows is  Linux is free and open source , windows are  not open source. 
Linux considered more secure due to its open-source nature, windows are less secure.
Linux is free of cost , windows are not free of cost.

Then, we discussed about different types of companies.
           
            product based companies 
            service based companies 
            startup companies

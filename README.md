 First day of training 

In first day of training, i learned about linux in detail and different types of companies. 
   
    Linux is the core of the operating system,            responsible for managing hardware resources and providing a platform for other software.
Linux is open source and much better than windows.Linux is known for its stability and security. 
To install Linux on laptops , there are some steps to followed: 
       
       Download Virtualbox 7.1.10
       Download Microsoft c++ visual studio 
       Download ubnut desktop 24.04.2 LTS 

The main difference between Linux and windows is  Linux is free and open source , windows are  not open source. 
Linux considered more secure due to its open-source nature, windows are less secure.
Linux is free of cost , windows are not free of cost.

Then, we discussed about different types of companies.
           
            product based companies 
            service based companies 
            startup companies

After that I learned about Booting and its types 
  
Booting - Booting is the process of starting or resetting a computer.
 It has two main types: 

   cold booting and warm booting. 

Cold booting is starting a computer from a completely powered-off state, while warm booting is restarting a computer that is already on.

  Introduction to Kernel , Shell its types and    different commands
 
Kernel -   In an operating system, the kernel is the core component that acts as a bridge between the hardware and the software.

Shell
 In an operating system, a shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel, allowing users to interact with the system by executing commands. 

 Types of shell 
      
        Bash - Most common shell
        sh - original shell
        zsh- more features 
        fish- modern, interactive 

 Shell categories 
        1. command line shell
        3. Graphical shell

File System Structure
   
       directory              function 
       / (Root):       The top-level directory, from which all other directories branch out.
     
      /bin:            Contains executable programs .
     
      /boot:            Stores files needed for booting the system, including the kernel.
     
       /dev:            Contains device files that represent hardware devices.
     
       /home:           Personal directories for users. 
     
       /lib:             Contains library files that are used by programs.
   
       /media:            Mount point for removable media like USB drives.
    
       /mnt:             Temporary mount point for file systems.
    
       /opt:            Contains optional apps.
   
       /srv:            Contains data for services provided by the system.
     
       /tmp:            Stores temporary files.
    
      /usr:            Contains user-related programs, libraries, and documentation.
    
      /var:           Stores variable data, such as log files, user tracking data, and caches.  

  commands
  
               Commands           Description                         Syntax
   
               ls               List the contents                     ls(options)

             date          Show the current date and time .           date

             whoami         Display the current username.              whomami    

             cd               change the directory .                  cd[directory]

             mkdir              To create new directory                mkdir directory_name

             cat                Create a list with contents            cat>filename

             touch               create file without content          touch filename

             cp                  copy the files                        cp[source]

             pwd                 print the current working directory       pwd

             whereis              show location of binary ,source         whereis[command]

Dual Booting 
Dual-booting refers to the process of installing and running two different operating systems on a single computer, allowing the user to choose which one to use when starting the machine. 

  BARE METAL INSTALLATION 

  Bare metal installation of linux means installing the operating on a computer's hardware , without any intermediary virtualization software.


VM ware 

vm  ware is a commercial product known for its enterprise - grade  features , performence and comprehensive support .

Partitioning Schemes :
Dividing a hard disk into seperate sections .
Each section acts as an independent disk.
Help organize data and install multiple OS.

 Its Types:

 MBR(MASTER  BOOT RECORD )

 maximum 4 primary partitions . Support upto 2 TB.It stores partition info in one place.It has less flexibility.

 GPT(GUID PARTITION TABLE)

 It supports upto 128 partitions .It supports disks larger than 2 TB.More flexibile.
 
File and directory permissions 

 File permissions are the backbone of Linux security, ensuring that only authorized users and processes interact with your data.

 Types of Commands
          1    chomd (change mode)
          
          1. It is used to change the permissions(read, write, execute) of files or directories.
          syntax - chmod[permission] [filename]*for permission 

          2.  chmod +x filename.sh
                   +x enables execute files.
      
         3. chmod 444 filename.sh
            Gives permissions to read only files.

         4. chmod 644 filename.sh
            It enables permissions only to owner 2.

2  chown- change owner
       
        chown user:group file.txt
        Change the owner to user Change the group to group so that other users in that group can access the file .










Redirection

Redirection in Linux means sending the output or input of a command to somewhere else, like a file.
Example: echo "Hello" >day3.txt
redirecting the message 'hello' t file 'day3.txt'

         
           Redirection Operators in Linux
       Type        	Symbol         	Example Command	     
       Output	        >           	echo "Hello" > file.txt      
       Append	        >>          	echo "World" >> file.txt	      
       Input         	<	           wc -l < file.txt	         


 Pipe In Linux 

 Pipe - Take the output of one command and pass it to another command .
 example- You have many files in a folder and you want to see only the file that ends with .sh

     syntax 
     command1|command2
     command1-generates output
     command2- takes that output as input
